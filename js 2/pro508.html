        Arrow functions do not have their own this. They are not well suited for defining object methods. Arrow functions are not hoisted. They must be defined before they are used. Using const is safer than using var, because a function expression is always constant value. You can only omit the return keyword and the curly brackets if the function is a single statement. Because of this, it might be a good habit to always keep them:
